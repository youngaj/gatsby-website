Office politics is defined as being able to negotiate, influence, engage, convince and persuade others. With that definition in mind it is easy to see why in most organizations, office politics is a key factor in determining what work is prioritized and how it gets accomplished. Mastery of office politics also yields positive results for the wilder. Benefits include reduced stress, improved performance, reputation and career progression.</p>\n<p>If studies have clearly shown the benefits of office politics the natural question is: why isn’t everyone doing it? The answer to this question lies within the organization’s political landscape that is set by the dominant group and geared towards keeping that group in power. For most organizations this dominant group is Caucasian males. When women and other minority groups engage in office politics their results are not the same as their white-male counterparts. For example, while displaying a competitive trait may garner success for a white-male this same behavior displayed by a minority may elicit a negative response.</p>\n<p>Navigating the narrow path between career advancement and subtle cultural landmines can take a real toll on minorities who attempt to play the game of office politics. The characteristics required for office politics may run contrary to the natural personality of many minorities. This has the effect of causing some to reject leadership roles while others are left feeling emotionally drained.</p>\n<p>What can be done to resolve this problem? Some think the solution is more training but studies have proved that a lack of political skills is not the problem. A promising avenue is focusing on changing the culture to a more cooperative and supportive environment. Environments such as these, that invite a diverse range of behaviors, have the added benefit of helping everyone including those already in the dominant group. Successful execution of this strategy depends on those currently in power being willing to change the very systems that helped them achieve success. They must be willing to change the game to one that is inclusive for everyone.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 02, 2022","slug":"office-politics","title":"Office Politics is not a level playing field"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"office-politics"}}}
